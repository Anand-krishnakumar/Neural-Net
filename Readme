HOW TO RUN:
python3 NeuralNet.py

NOTE:
Run the program by running one activation function at a time in the main function. They are sepearted as sigmoid activation function, tanh activation function and relu activation function comment blocks.
For example, relu activation function is run by the following calls: 

neural_network.train(activation = "relu", max_iterations = 1000, learning_rate = 0.009)
neural_network.predict(activation = "relu" )
